# Platformer, Fall 2018
Arun Atchuthananthan

I used Java canvas libraries to create a 2D platform game, with unlimited ever-changing levels, enemy entities, character customization, and mechanic changes. I also implemented libraries to add sound tracks, multiplayer modes, in-game coin exchange systems, as well as The game was inspired by interest in game development prior to my familiarization with Unity and C#. Using my knowledge in Java, I also collaborated with Henry Wang, Kene Ochuba, and Eugene Ye to develop games which ranged from top-down platformers to educational learning tools.
